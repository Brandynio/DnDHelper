                <h2>Welcome to the DnD Helper!</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="ScrollBody">
                <p>This website is a helper tool for playing Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
                <p>Right now we provide you with the ability to create characters, roll dice, search DnD things, and
                    track
                    initiative.</p>
                <h2Character Creation</h2>
                <p>This tool allows you to create a character. Right now we don't have full character sheets available
                    but the
                    main statistics along with some basic information about the character can be stored. Characters you
                    create
                    will be stored in local storage, meaning your browser will store them on your machine.</p>
                <h2>Dice Roller</h2>
                <p>With the dice roller, you can roll any amount of dice with any amount of sides. You can also choose
                    whether
                    you want to see the individual rolls, the total, or both!</p>
                <h2>Search</h2>
                <p>Using the <a href="http://www.dnd5eapi.co/">D&D 5e Api</a> we allow you to search for classes,
                    features, and
                    spells!</p>
                <h2>Initiative Tracker</h2>
                <p>The initiative tracker will help Dungeon Masters keep track of whose turn it is, and how much health
                    everyone
                    in the fight has.</p>
                <p>If you log in and have created characters, you can import those characters into your initiative
                    order.</p>
                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>The tools and features above are all we have planned at this moment. However, if we were to continue
                    with
                    this project, here is what we would expand on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fuller character sheets</li>
                    <li>More search options</li>
                    <li>User accounts</li>
                    <li>Deleting characters</li>
                </ul>
