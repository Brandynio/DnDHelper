        <h2>Welcome to the DnD Helper!</h2>
        <p>This website is a helper tool for playing Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
        <p>Right now we provide you with the ability to create characters, roll dice, search DnD things, and track initiative.</p>
        <p>Character Creation requires you to create an account, but the other tools can be used without it.</p>
        <h4>Character Creation</h4>
        <p>This tool requires you to create an account so we can save your characters. Right now we don't have full character sheets available but the main statistics along with some basic information about the character can be stored.</p>
        <h4>Dice Roller</h4>
        <p>With the dice roller, you can roll any amount of dice with any amount of sides. You can also choose whether you want to see the individual rolls, the total, or both!</p>
        <h4>Search</h4>
        <p>Using the <a href="http://www.dnd5eapi.co/">D&D 5e Api</a> we allow you to search for classes, features, and spells!</p>
        <h4>Initiative Tracker</h4>
        <p>The initiative tracker will help Dungeon Masters keep track of whose turn it is, and how much health everyone in the fight has.</p>
        <p>If you log in and have created characters, you can import those characters into your initiative order.</p>
        <h5>Future Plans</h5>
        <p>The tools and features are all we have planned at this moment. However, if we were to continue with this project, here is what we would expand on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuller character sheets</li>
            <li>More search options</li>
        </ul>
